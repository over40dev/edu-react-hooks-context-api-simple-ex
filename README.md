# React Hooks and Context API

## Simple Example using React Functional Components

### Expense Tracker

Starter code based on a React version of Brad Traversy's [Vanilla JS Expense Tracker](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects/tree/master/expense-tracker). It uses functional components with hooks and the context API.

## Variations in Logic to showcase

- Destructuring with Ternary Operator to return multiple dynamic values
- Destructuring with Ternary Operator inside ` reduce() ` to return multiple dynamic values

## Usage

```terminal
npm install

# Run on http://localhost:3000
npm start

# Build for prod
npm run build
```
